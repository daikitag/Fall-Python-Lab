# COVID Race Analysis

As a first step in this analysis, I examined the following things:
1. Plot the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in different race groups.
2. Plot the mortality rates of COVID-19 and examine how actual numbers and rates can be different.

Next steps:
1. Gather more data that examines the relationship between COVID-19 and socioeconomic factors
2. Conduct chi-squared test to conclude that black people are more likely to die from COVID
3. Conduct regression analysis to examine the differences in rate of increase
4. Adjust socioeconomic factors, such as age group and income, to examine the true differences between the race groups
